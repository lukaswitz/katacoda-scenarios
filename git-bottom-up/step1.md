Q: So what is git?

A: The [documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) book says:
"Git is a content-addressable filesystem".

Q: Well... thank you and wtf?

A: It also says:
"It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store."

Q: Okey. How do I store a think?

A: Let's start with creating an empty repository

`git init`{{execute}}

This is the command you would use to start a new repostiory locally.
It comes with several options that will be covered later.
